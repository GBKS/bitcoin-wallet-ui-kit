# The mighty Bitcoin wallet UI kit

_Heads up: It's a work in progress_

View it on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/916680391812923706/Bitcoin-Wallet-UI-Kit-(work-in-progress)).

Many designers on Bitcoin products find themselves designing the same set of UI components that have already been thought through by others. The goal of this UI kit is to provide a strong foundation for prototypes, concept explorations and real projects to kickstart their design processes. By not having to worry about the basics, designers can then focus on what makes their products unique. This is part of my work for the [Bitcoin Design Community](https://bitcoin.design).

This kit ideally evolves over time to include more best practices, use cases and application types, based on the needs of open-source Bitcoin designers and projects.

## What's included

## How to use it

You will need a Figma account to use the kit. On the [kit page](https://www.figma.com/community/file/916680391812923706/Bitcoin-Wallet-UI-Kit-(work-in-progress)), press `Duplicate` to create your own copy of the file. You can freely modify it and use it as you desire.

Some use case ideas:

- The foundation for a new Bitcoin wallet project
- A reference for how to solve a specific user flow or interface execution
- Create mockups and prototypes to include in the [Bitcoin Design Guide](https://bitcoin.design/guide/)
- Developers can pick certain elements from the UI kit to include in their application
- What else...?

Also check out the [WalletUI](https://github.com/reez/WalletUI) project on Github by [reez](https://github.com/reez). He's turning this kit into an iOS library. Super cool!
