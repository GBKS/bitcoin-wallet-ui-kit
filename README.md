# The mighty Bitcoin wallet UI kit

View it on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/916680391812923706/Bitcoin-Wallet-UI-Kit-(work-in-progress)).

Many designers on bitcoin products find themselves designing the same set of UI components that have already been thought through by others, and researching the same best practices. The goal of this UI kit is to provide a strong foundation for prototypes, concept explorations and real projects to kickstart their design processes. By not having to worry about the basics, designers can then focus on what makes their products unique. This project grew out of the [Bitcoin Design Guide](https://bitcoin.design/guide) by the [Bitcoin Design Community](https://bitcoin.design).
